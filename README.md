📊 Competition Metrics
PESQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality)
Purpose: Measures speech quality as perceived by humans
Range: 1.0 (poor) to 4.5 (excellent)
Usage: Primary metric for speech signals
Target: >3.0 for competitive performance
SDR (Signal-to-Distortion Ratio)
Purpose: Measures overall audio quality
Range: -∞ to +∞ dB (higher is better)
Usage: Primary metric for music signals
Target: >12 dB for competitive performance

Purpose: Predicts speech intelligibility
Range: 0.0 (unintelligible) to 1.0 (perfect)
Usage: Additional speech metric
Target: >0.7 for good intelligibility
Competition Scoring Formula
Python
# Official competition score calculation
normalized_sdr = (sdr_score / 30.0) * 4.5
competition_score = 0.6 * pesq_score + 0.4 * normalized_sdr
🎯 Model Complexity
GMAC/s Calculation
The model complexity is measured in GMAC/s (Giga Multiply-Accumulate operations per second):

Python
# Automatic complexity calculation
model_gmacs = GMACalculator.calculate_gmacs(model, input_shape, device)
print(f"Model complexity: {model_gmacs:.2f} GMAC/s")

# Competition constraint
if model_gmacs < 50.0:
    print("✅ Complexity within competition limit")
else:
    print("❌ Model exceeds complexity limit")
Complexity Optimization
Architecture Pruning: Optimized layer sizes
Efficient Operations: Depthwise convolutions where applicable
Bottleneck Design: Reduced-dimension LSTM processing
Skip Connection Efficiency: Minimal overhead connections

🐛 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
1. CUDA Out of Memory
Python
# Solution: Reduce batch size
BATCH_SIZE = 4  # Instead of 8
# Or enable gradient checkpointing
torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint(model, input)
2. PESQ Calculation Error
bash
# Solution: Install correct PESQ version
pip uninstall pesq
pip install pesq==0.0.4
3. JSON Serialization Error
Python
# Already fixed in our implementation
# Uses ensure_json_serializable() function
results = ensure_json_serializable(raw_results)
4. File Pairing Issues
Python
# Ensure correct file naming
reverb/
├── audio_001.wav
├── audio_002.wav
clean/
├── audio_001.wav  # Same number
├── audio_002.wav  # Same number
5. Model Complexity Exceeds Limit
Python
# Reduce model size
BASE_CHANNELS = 24      # Instead of 32
BOTTLENECK_DIM = 48     # Instead of 64
N_DPRNN_BLOCKS = 2      # Instead of 3
Performance Issues
Slow Training
Reduce dataset size for initial testing
Enable mixed precision training
Use smaller batch size if memory constrained
Disable augmentation for faster loading
Poor Metrics
Increase dataset size (more training data)
Adjust loss weights (favor PESQ or SDR)
Tune learning rate (try 5e-4 or 2e-3)
Increase training epochs (35-50 epochs)
📊 Advanced Usage
Custom Dataset
Python
# For custom dataset structure
class CustomDereverbDataset(FullDatasetHandler):
    def _find_all_files(self):
        # Custom file discovery logic
        reverb_files = custom_file_finder(self.reverb_dir)
        clean_files = custom_file_finder(self.clean_dir)
        return list(zip(reverb_files, clean_files))
Model Inference
Python
# Load trained model for inference
model = ProfessionalDereverbModel()
checkpoint = torch.load("best_model.pth")
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
model.eval()

# Process audio
with torch.no_grad():
    clean_audio = model(reverberant_audio)
Hyperparameter Tuning
Python
# Grid search example
learning_rates = [1e-4, 5e-4, 1e-3, 2e-3]
batch_sizes = [4, 6, 8, 12]

for lr in learning_rates:
    for bs in batch_sizes:
        result = train_with_params(lr=lr, batch_size=bs)
        print(f"LR: {lr}, BS: {bs}, Score: {result['score']}")
